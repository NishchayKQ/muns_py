it should have a feature to show monthly spending
    if possible make a category wise  graph


it should add stuff to category like i dont want flooded with stuff like
chicken 65, chicken biryani n all, under say a non veg category all these get
logged
    that said it should save in detail within the category


so each purchase will have:
    category (ability to change from some feature) #must support multi category
        like discord labels where say i click on drink label and it shows:
            amount of drinks consumed (last month/week)
            money spent on drinks category
    cost of purchase
    date and time of purchase (with ability to change)
    a note about purchase 
    


i want stuff like coke n all in limit so a feature counting within a 
category:
    #therefore multi category system


a category limit, say drink category limit has been reached
    items that share drink category will get warning on next purchase
